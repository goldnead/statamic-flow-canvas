/**
 * The canvas half of the node-output contract.
 *
 * Which handles a node has is declared once, by the node, on the server
 * (`outputSpec()`); the host's registry ships that declaration to the browser
 * inside the node-library payload, and this file resolves it against a node's
 * live config. It evaluates a spec — it knows no node types, which is why it
 * can be shared.
 *
 * Before 1.7.0 the canvas held its own copy of the rule instead: a chain of
 * `if (type === 'switch')` / `'loop'` / `'parallel'` in `useAutoLayout.js`,
 * including how each of them reads `config.cases` and `config.branches`. The
 * mirror was accurate for the built-ins and empty for everybody else — a
 * third-party node got one `default` handle whatever it declared in PHP,
 * because `NodeRegistry::describe()` did not expose outputs at all.
 *
 * The outputs have to be resolvable synchronously: they are read during
 * layout, during render, and again while the user is typing into a switch's
 * cases. So the payload is a spec the frontend evaluates, not a resolved list
 * fetched per keystroke.
 *
 * ## Where the specs come from
 *
 * `setNodeOutputSpecs(library)` is called once by the page that owns the
 * canvas, with the `library` prop the server rendered. The store is module-level rather than provided/injected because
 * `outputsFor()` is called from pure helpers (`useAutoLayout`,
 * `useGraphMutations`) that take plain data and no component context.
 *
 * A node type with no spec — an unknown type, a node from an addon that has
 * since been removed, or any node at all before the library has been set —
 * gets the same single `default` continuation the canvas gave every custom
 * node before this release. It is the one assumption that cannot make a
 * stored graph unreadable: an edge on a handle the node does not offer still
 * lays out (`computeLayout` trails unexpected outputs after the declared
 * ones) and is still saved untouched.
 */

/**
 * Version of the spec grammar this canvas understands.
 *
 * Kept in step with `NodeOutputs::VERSION` on the server. The two travel
 * together, but the built assets are published into the host's
 * `public/vendor/`, so a stale copy meeting a newer server is a real shape.
 * A spec numbered higher than this is therefore not guessed at: it resolves
 * to the single `default` output, which is what a canvas that had never heard
 * of output specs did with the same node. Lower numbers stay readable — every
 * field this version understands is one an older payload simply does not use.
